# Improving-Diabetes-Care-Coordination-through-Healthcare-Data-Integration

# Summary 

I've always been interested in how data can transform healthcare delivery, particularly for patients managing chronic conditions. This project digs into how fragmented healthcare data impacts diabetes care in California. Using public hospital datasets from the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal, I'm analyzing patterns in care coordination to uncover where the gaps are and how we might improve patient outcomes.

Iâ€™ll do this by integrating inpatient, emergency, and county-level data to show how poor coordination leads to patients ending up back in the hospital. The overall goal is to demonstrate how standardized medical codes like ICD-10, CPT, and LONIC, combined with data harmonization techniques, can aid healthcare systems improve care for diabetes patients while reducing unnecessary cost.
